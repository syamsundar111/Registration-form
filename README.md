# User Registration Form Validation Project  #

This project comprises an HTML form for user registration with client-side validation using JavaScript. It ensures that users enter correct and valid information in the registration form fields.

##  Project Structure  ##

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the registration form.
- `style.css`: Includes styles for the form elements, error messages, and success indicators.
- `script.js`: Implements the client-side validation logic for the form inputs.

##  Form Fields  ##

The form includes the following fields for user registration:

1. **Name**: Accepts text input, validates for length (between 3 and 20 characters).
2. **Phone Number**: Accepts numeric input, validates for a valid Indian phone number format.
3. **Password**: Accepts password input, validates for length (between 7 and 14 characters).
4. **Confirm Password**: Confirms the entered password.
5. **Email**: Accepts email input, validates for a correct email format.

## Validation Logic

- Each field is checked for empty inputs and specific criteria based on its type.
- Errors are displayed below the respective input fields along with red borders.
- Success indicators (green borders) are shown upon valid input.

# Running the Project
